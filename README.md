# Dataset attributes analysis

## Goals


1.Acquire two appropriate datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository and provide an exploratory analysis of its content:

2.Dataset requirements:

- at least five numerical attributes attributes 
- at least 1000 instances

3.Subtasks:

- scatter plot of EACH attribute pair (matrix of plots), on diagonal a histogram of given attribute is expected
- scatter plot of each attribute pair with histograms on axes (write a function that generates plot for given attributes pair)
- correlation (for EACH attribute pair, if appropriate)
- covariances (for EACH attribute pair, if appropriate)

4.Elaborate on results.


## Datasets

Two dataset were used: 
- UCI Air polution
- UCI Concrete
